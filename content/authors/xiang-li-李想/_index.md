Xiang is currently in her second year as a Research Master in the amazing Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Her research interests include stochastic processes, Markov chains, and machine learning algorithms. She is currently working on her master's project-the study of stationary distributions for SGD algorithms, with Prof. Qiaomin Xie, who is also from ISyE dept. and is a nice, wonderful advisor.
She also serves as a research assistant in the Implementation of Science and Engineering Lab (ISELab) from the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Led by Prof. Andrew Quanbeck, ISELab is a great team and a perfect place to apply engineering techniques to the research of implementing science.
